# Linear-Classification-using-the-perceptron-Learning-Rule-Using Separable Data
My model employs the perceptron learning rule to train a linear classifier on a two feature engine condition binary classification. I use simulated engine condition data for use in triggering time-to-failure 
calculations

My model's Learning goal: create the “trigger” by 
finding a good classifier and using it as 
a boundary to sound the alarm problem. 

Our model deals with 2 features, engine variable 1 and engine variable 2.
 

In terms of built-in python libraries, I used pandas to load our .csv files, numpy to handle arrays and matrix mathematics, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, and sklearn for a variety of machine learning tasks and confusion matrix visualization.
